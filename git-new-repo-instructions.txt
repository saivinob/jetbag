Instructions shown when we create a new repo.

  echo "# sometext" >> README.md
  git init
  git add README.md
  git commit -m "first commit"
  git branch -M main
  git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<reponame>.git
  git push -u origin main

Note: If we already have a local repo which we are planning to upload
to github.com, then just create bare repo, do not add any README.md or
LICENSE files. Doing so gives errors later when we are trying to push
saying repos heads do not match or use fast-forward or something like
that.
